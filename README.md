This demo landing page was primarily an exercise in css fundamentals.

In addition to giving me the opportunity to write more complicated html, this project allowed me to experiment with images, font-styles, colors and layouts, all of which has helped me gain a better understanding of the box model and the processes of working with flexbox in general.

Also, I got to look at pictures of cats, which (in my experience) is always a good time!
